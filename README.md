Tower of Hanoi â€“ Recursive Problem Description
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic recursive problem that involves moving a set of disks from one rod to another, following specific rules.

 Problem Statement:
You are given three rods and N disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. Initially, all the disks are stacked in increasing size on one rod (the source rod), with the largest disk at the bottom and the smallest at the top.

Your task is to move all the disks from the source rod to the destination rod using the helper (auxiliary) rod, following these rules:

 Rules:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move consists of taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on another rod.
No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
